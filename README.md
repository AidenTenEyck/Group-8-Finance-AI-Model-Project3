# Group-8-Finance-AI-Model-Project3
**Project Goals:**

Our goal for this project was to create a generative AI language model capable of answering finance related questions and predict stock price movements.
The user interface for our AI model is located in the main file and uses Gradio to allow input and display its output.
Our model in addition to being able to answer a wide variety of finance related question is also able to plot line graphs that can be used as a more visable appealing way of showcasing its prediction capabilities.
